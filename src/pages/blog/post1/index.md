## Our goal

As part of CS449, we had to picked a project theme as a prompt to design an application to real-world problems.

We choose "maintaining good work-life balance" as a prompt as we felt in this digital age with global-first companies,
it is very easy to overwork and ignore work-life balance. We experienced this first hand as employees in our co-op terms
as well as students in our study terms.

Our goal was to design an application that creates work-life balance by giving users more mental capacity in the form
of a productivity app that actually works!

## Our value proposition

### What are we?

Our original slogan was "Make the most of your time".

The high-level problem being solved is to make productivity easier to approach. Many productivity tools such as calendars and Pomodoro techniques require discipline in the first place. Many people who need help with productivity lack the discipline to use existing productivity tools. For example, many students use Pomodoro just to end up going over breaks and delaying work sessions. Our project aims to resolve this tool by using heuristics to automate and enforce certain productivity techniques to help users feel good about the work and effort they are exerting.

There were many motivations behind this project idea. One of which is how many of the team members face issues with keeping on track with their work, especially in this digital age where distractions lay at every corner of the internet, in our mobile devices, and in our computers. We foresee this project as something that we would use in the future, which is what motivates us to design this project.

### Why us?

Current solutions are hard to learn and hard to stick with. Generally, most apps are some form of a calendar or to-do list, which still require too much personal discipline on the user’s end. All of these current tools still require users to plan their own days and continuously open the app day after day. For example, with Google Calendar, I would need to plan out all my tasks each day by hand, which is actually a big barrier to productivity. In addition, many popular tools such as Notion are difficult to learn and use, making the barrier to productivity even higher for beginners. In a world where entertainment is driven by TikTok and short clips under 30 seconds, not many people have the attention span or work ethic to stick with productivity tools that exist.

We aim to make productivity fun above everything else. It’s not necessarily about optimizing your day or burning yourself out, but instead getting people on the right path and helping guide them to a more productive life. This comes with features including gamification, productivity assistants through AI, and also leeway for productivity beginners to make it easier for them to get started. In general, we want to minimize the amount of the work that the user needs to do to be productive. We want to minimize barriers to productivity to keep them motivated and willing to stick with the app.

### How will it help?

Many people find that it is difficult to balance their work with their personal life. There is a limited amount of time one person can spend in a day on any specific task, as well people need to continue to be as productive as before if they choose to dedicate more time to the “life” part of work life balance. People also find that they are easily distracted when trying to focus on their work, burnout from overworking, and have issues with maintaining long term motivation and discipline when attempting to work towards larger goals.

The optimal solution to these problems would have the following outcomes. First, users would find that their working hours are more productive - they are less distracted and better at maintaining the personal discipline required to concentrate on the task at hand. Second, users would find that increased productivity during their working hours allows them to spend more time on personal activities - like spending time with family and friends. Third, users would find that they are more motivated when pursuing long term goals, can plan and follow through with their plan for accomplishing the long term goal better, and that with better work life balance they do not get burned out.
