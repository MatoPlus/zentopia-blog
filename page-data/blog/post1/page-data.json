In the bustling world of the digital age, where global-first companies have become the norm, the boundaries between work and personal life often blur, leading to overwork and neglect of our well-being. As a team of dedicated students, we have personally experienced the impact of this issue during our co-op terms as employees and our study terms as students.</p>\n<p>For our CS449 project, we had the opportunity to choose a theme that would inspire us to create an application capable of tackling real-world problems. After thoughtful consideration, we unanimously selected \"maintaining good work-life balance\" as our driving prompt. We believe that fostering a harmonious relationship between work and personal life is crucial for overall well-being and long-term success, and that's where our app comes into play.</p>\n<p>The primary aim of our project was clear: to design an application that empowers users to achieve a balanced lifestyle by enhancing their productivity and mental capacity. While numerous productivity apps exist in the market, we noticed a common pitfall — many of them fall short of delivering tangible results. Our mission, therefore, was to create a productivity app that actually works! A tool that not only helps users manage their tasks efficiently but also promotes the importance of self-care and mindful breaks, ensuring they can thrive in both their professional and personal pursuits.</p>\n<p>Throughout this blog, we will walk you through our design process step-by-step, sharing our ideas, challenges, and breakthroughs. We hope to create an insightful and engaging narrative that not only documents our journey but also provides valuable insights into the world of app development, user experience design, and the ever-critical aspect of work-life balance.</p>\n<h2>Our Value Proposition</h2>\n<h3>What are we?</h3>\n<p>Our original slogan was \"Make the most of your time\".</p>\n<p>The high-level problem being solved is to make productivity easier to approach. Many productivity tools such as calendars and Pomodoro techniques require discipline in the first place. Many people who need help with productivity lack the discipline to use existing productivity tools. For example, many students use Pomodoro just to end up going over breaks and delaying work sessions. Our project aims to resolve this tool by using heuristics to automate and enforce certain productivity techniques to help users feel good about the work and effort they are exerting.</p>\n<p>There were many motivations behind this project idea. One of which is how many of the team members face issues with keeping on track with their work, especially in this digital age where distractions lay at every corner of the internet, in our mobile devices, and in our computers. We foresee this project as something that we would use in the future, which is what motivates us to design this project.</p>\n<h3>Why us?</h3>\n<p>Current solutions are hard to learn and hard to stick with. Generally, most apps are some form of a calendar or to-do list, which still require too much personal discipline on the user’s end. All of these current tools still require users to plan their own days and continuously open the app day after day. For example, with Google Calendar, I would need to plan out all my tasks each day by hand, which is actually a big barrier to productivity. In addition, many popular tools such as Notion are difficult to learn and use, making the barrier to productivity even higher for beginners. In a world where entertainment is driven by TikTok and short clips under 30 seconds, not many people have the attention span or work ethic to stick with productivity tools that exist.</p>\n<p>We aim to make productivity fun above everything else. It’s not necessarily about optimizing your day or burning yourself out, but instead getting people on the right path and helping guide them to a more productive life. This comes with features including gamification, productivity assistants through AI, and also leeway for productivity beginners to make it easier for them to get started. In general, we want to minimize the amount of the work that the user needs to do to be productive. We want to minimize barriers to productivity to keep them motivated and willing to stick with the app.</p>\n<h3>How will it help?</h3>\n<p>Many people find that it is difficult to balance their work with their personal life. There is a limited amount of time one person can spend in a day on any specific task, as well people need to continue to be as productive as before if they choose to dedicate more time to the “life” part of work life balance. People also find that they are easily distracted when trying to focus on their work, burnout from overworking, and have issues with maintaining long term motivation and discipline when attempting to work towards larger goals.</p>\n<p>The optimal solution to these problems would have the following outcomes. First, users would find that their working hours are more productive - they are less distracted and better at maintaining the personal discipline required to concentrate on the task at hand. Second, users would find that increased productivity during their working hours allows them to spend more time on personal activities - like spending time with family and friends. Third, users would find that they are more motivated when pursuing long term goals, can plan and follow through with their plan for accomplishing the long term goal better, and that with better work life balance they do not get burned out.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Problem","date":"July 28, 2023"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/post1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
